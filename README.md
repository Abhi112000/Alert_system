Home Security using motion sensing
A motion sensor project that detects motion and sounds an alarm accordingly. This software system is designed in C# and .net that constantly monitors an environment using a camera and sounds an alarm and even records images of the motion taking place as soon as it takes place. The project works as follows:
•	The user first needs to set a security code.
•	As soon as the user sets the code and activates the system, monitoring starts.
•	The motion detector algorithm now constantly monitors the environment to check for any movement.
•	As soon any movement takes place in front of the camera the alarm is activated.
•	Now the system sounds its alarm and even takes photos of the motion taking place.
•	The user now needs to deactivate the alarm by entering the security code again.

Software Requirements:
•	Windows Xp, Windows 7(ultimate, enterprise) 
•	Visual studio 2010
Hardware Components:
•	Processor – i3
•	Hard Disk – 5 GB
•	Memory – 1GB RAM

Advantages:
•	The system is easy to install and is fully authorized.
•	It can be used as home protection and security purposes for users.
•	It is not an electronic based system so one can easily make use of laptops to install this system.
•	It is cost-effective.
•	It also saves the motions occurred so that they can be used as an evidence.
•	It maximizes accuracy and reduces energy usage.

 
Applications:
